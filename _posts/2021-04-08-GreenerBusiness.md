# I created a completely free Environmental Management System framework\

An Environmental Management System (EMS) is a brilliant way to audit your organisation in terms of sustainability, a great tool for setting goals, and a brilliant way to communicate what you're doing.\
**But...**\
Most tools out there are targeted at larger, more complex businesses, often tailored towards achieving an ISO 14001 accreditation , which is a long way off most SMEs aims.\
You can easily get a consultant to work with you to produce your EMS, as long as you're willing to spend a few hundred/thousand pounds. I have got no issue with this (indeed if you'd like help with you EMS I quite happily accept payment for my services!), however, I think it's crucial that all businesses, no matter what size or budget can develop an EMS.\
**So, I built the [Greener Business EMS](https://www.greener-business.co.uk) and made it available for free.**\
Anybody, at any stage of business can build an EMS and improve their sustainability with this framework. There's a guide to take you through the process, with templates and samples of all the documents you need, alongside a Business Survey to spark your thoughts on how to improve.\
*Here's to a green recovery in 2021.*\
