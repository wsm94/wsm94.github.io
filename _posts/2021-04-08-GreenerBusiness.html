<h2>I created a completely free Environmental Management System framework</h2>
<p>An Environmental Management System (EMS) is a brilliant way to audit your organisation in terms of sustainability, a great tool for setting goals, and a brilliant way to communicate what you're doing.</p>
<p><strong>But...</strong></p>
<p>Most tools out there are targeted at larger, more complex businesses, often tailored towards achieving an ISO 14001 accreditation , which is a long way off most SMEs' aims.</p>
<p>You can easily get a consultant to work with you to produce your EMS, as long as you're willing to spend a few hundred/thousand pounds. I have got no issue with this (indeed if you'd like help with you EMS I quite happily accept payment for my services!), however, I think it's crucial that all businesses, no matter what size or budget can develop an EMS.</p>
<p><strong>So, I built the <a href="https://www.greener-business.co.uk">Greener Business EMS</a> and made it available for free.</strong></p>
<p>Anybody, at any stage of business can build an EMS and improve their sustainability with this framework. There's a guide to take you through the process, with templates and samples of all the documents you need, alongside a Business Survey to spark your thoughts on how to improve.</p>
<p>Here's to a green recovery in 2021.</p>
