    <h1 class="page-heading">Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my personal site.</p>
    <p>This is intended to be kept as a pretty simple touchpoint for finding out what's going on with me: what I've done, what I'm doing, and any other long-form word vomit kept in my <a href="blog.html">blog</a>.</p>
    <p>This will develop over time, so keep an eye out. I will update shortly with an e-mail address I'm happy for anybody to reach out to. In the meantime the best way to get hold of me is to connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willsinclairmarshall/">LinkedIn</a> and send me an IM.</p>
    <p>Cheers.</p>
