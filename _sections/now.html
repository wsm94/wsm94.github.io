<h3>What Just Happened?!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.whatjusthappened.news/" target="_blank">What Just Happened</a> is a weekly, semi-satirical blog, in which myself and my good friend <a href="https://alistairsimmonds.com/" target="_blank">Ali Simmonds-Yoo</a> give our take on some interesting bits of the week's news. We try to keep it reasonably amusing, but more importantly, well-researched and properly referenced!</p>

<h3>Found and Ruby on Rails</h3>
<p>Found is a major project, which I'm hoping will soon be launched into a fully-fledged business! It's currently still in testing, but the alpha version will be live very soon - watch this space.</p>
<p>In the process, I'm teaching myself Ruby and <a>Ruby on Rails</a> - it's an incredibly powerful framework, I highly recommend - and learning more html, css and javascript.</p>

<h3>Other Stuff:</h3>

    <p>- I'm getting back into contrast showers, bracing, but awesome! <a href="https://www.wimhofmethod.com/" target="_blank">Wim Hof</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb0h8ZKvJW4" target="_blank">Tedx talk</a></p>
