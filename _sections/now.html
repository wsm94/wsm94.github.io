<h3>What Just Happened?!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.whatjusthappened.news/" target="_blank">What Just Happened</a> is a weekly, semi-satirical blog, in which myself and my good friend <a href="https://alistairsimmonds.com/" target="_blank">Ali Simmonds-Yoo</a> give our take on some interesting bits of the week's news. We try to keep it reasonably amusing, but more importantly, well-researched and properly referenced!</p>

<h3>Greener Business</h3>
<p>I have created a free suite of documentation to assist businesses (particularly SMEs) produce Environmental Management Systems that are simple, but help to avoid 'Greenwashing'. I'm excited for a Green and Sustainable recovery in mid-2021.</p>

<h3>Other Stuff:</h3>

<p>- Paragliding is my newest addiction, and it's absolutely fanstastic! Everybody should definitely give it a go. Occasional videos will go on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFxU7ZT2kVh3rl9yxOqD7mQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel</p>
    <p>- I'm using Chris Hemsworth's Centr app as my primary fitness and motivation source. It's more expensive than some of its competitors, but worth every penny. The library of coached workouts, yoga, meditation, and nutrition is second to none</p>
    <p>- Getting back into meditation with <a href="https://www.calm.com/" target="_blank">Calm</a> and <a href="https://wakingup.com/" target="_blank">Waking Up</a></p>
    <p>- Learning German with <a href="https://get.busuu.com/azFZM0p1TmkzYnM9" target="_blank">Busuu</a>, I've found this better than Duolingo as I've become more proficient</p>
<p>- Sourdough! So unoriginal, but it's a fun challenge.</p>
