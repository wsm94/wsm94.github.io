<h2>What I'm Doing Now</h2>
<h3>What Just Happened?!</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.whatjusthappened.news/" target="_blank">What Just Happened</a> is a weekly, semi-satirical blog, in which myself and my good friend <a href="https://alistairsimmonds.com/" target="_blank">Ali Simmonds-Yoo</a> give our take on some interesting bits of the week's news. We try to keep it reasonably amusing, but more importantly, well-researched and properly referenced!</p>
