<p>I am a lapsed engineer, having graduated with an MEng in General Engineering from Durham University (UK) in 2017. Following that I spent a year working for a pricipal contractor on major infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>These days I work with my family as a project manager for <a href="https://www.thebathhouseshop.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bath House</a>, alongside a bunch of very exciting projects (of which more <a href="#now">below</a>).</p>
<p>I live on the edge of the Lake District and love making the most of this beautiful part of the world!</p>
